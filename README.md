This code is refactored from:
`http://blog.otoro.net/2016/03/25/generating-abstract-patterns-with-tensorflow/`
`https://github.com/hardmaru/cppn-tensorflow`

The only major difference at this point is I removed the IPython dependency, and am now in a position where I feel comfortable editing the network, and adding new things onto it myself.

# Dependencies
I am currently using:
* numpy '1.14.5'
* tensorflow '1.11.0'
* cv2 '3.4.1'
* PIL '5.2.0'

# Run
`python3.6 run.py` will run with default values for everything and output a video 720p video to `videos/please_name_me.mp4`.

# Arguments
`python3.6 run.py --x_dim=1080 --y_dim=720 --z_dim=12 --scale=8 --neurons_per_layer=12 --number_of_layers=7 --color_channels=3 --number_of_stills=4 --interpolations_per_image=12 --file_name=./videos/please_name_me.mp4`

* `x_dim` : the width of the image/video
* `y_dim` : the height of the image/video
* `z_dim` : the dimension of the latent vector (larger means more complex images)
* `scale` : how zoomed in on the coordiantes you are (larger means more zoomed in image)
* `neurons_per_layer` : how many neurons on in each hidden layer of the neural network (larger means more complex images)
* `number_of_layers` : how many hidden layers in the neural network (larger means more complex images)
* `color_channels` : 3 for RGB images/video, 1 for black/white
* `number_of_stills` : how many latent vectors will be made to create images for the interpolations
* `interpolations_per_image` : how many images are between each "still"
* `file_name` : the output file that the video will be saved to

# run_edit
Inside of run_edit.py you can modify it to do what you want, on top of changing arguements. Here are some things you can do.

* Save a specific model
```
cppn.save_model('new_model')
```
* Load a specific model
```
cppn.load_model('new_model')
```

* Set the `model_name`, and `to_run` variables to the values you wish.
* Set the variables inside of the conditionals for the specific `to_run` you are using.
* If you change any arguements, like color channel, or network size, then you're going to have to create a new model, save it, and reload it.

# make_many_models
Edit the following variables inside the code to make a series of different models
## Variables for different images
* x_dim = 1440
* y_dim = 1080
* scale = 8
* color_channels = 1
* interpolations_per_image = 1

## Edit these to make specific types of models
* zs = list(range(7, 8))
* neurons = list(range(7,8))
* layers = list(range(7,8))

# gui
Run `gui.py` like so to create create load a model and visualize the latent space
```
python3.6 gui.py --model_name=7-7-7-2_ --outfile=test_many --model_dir=many_models/models
python3.6 gui.py --model_name=new_model --outfile=test_out --model_dir=saved_models
```

# Todos
* I'd like to add the ability to change the structure of the network even more, so allowing you to input a string like, 'tanh-softplus-tanh' or something, and then the network generate from said string.
* Refactor and add in the ability to use a database to train said network, i.e. more refactoring of http://blog.otoro.net/2016/04/01/generating-large-images-from-latent-vectors/
